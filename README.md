# Wardrobe

This project provides a simple Flask application that allows users to upload an image or provide a text description to receive outfit suggestions.

The `templates/index.html` page links to a small stylesheet under `static/styles.css` for basic layout and uses JavaScript to display the generated image returned by the API.

The repository now integrates a U^2-Net based cloth segmentation model. When the
pre-trained weights are available, real segmentation masks are produced for
images sent to the `/parse` endpoint. If the weights are missing, the parser
falls back to dummy data so the rest of the application continues to work.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Stub modules

The repository bundles lightweight replacements for `flask`, `werkzeug`,
`openai`, and `pytest` under the names `flask_stub`, `werkzeug_stub`,
`openai_stub`, and a minimal `pytest` package. These allow the code to run in
environments where the real dependencies are missing. Installing the genuine
packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt` will override the stubs and is
required for production use.

### Environment variables

The application uses the `openai` package to generate suggestions and images.
Set the following variable before running the server:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - your OpenAI API key

Run the development server. Set `FLASK_DEBUG=1` to enable debug mode:

```bash
FLASK_DEBUG=1 python app.py
```

If `FLASK_DEBUG` is unset or evaluates to false, the server runs without debug
enabled.

Then visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

### OpenAI API usage

When the real `openai` package is installed, the application communicates
directly with OpenAI's API to generate text and images. Any prompts or other
data you send will therefore be transmitted to a third-party service
(OpenAI) for processing.

For local tests the repository bundles an `openai_stub` module that mimics the
API without making network calls. Replace this stub with the genuine `openai`
package in production so the application can contact OpenAI's servers.

## Cloth Segmentation Model

Real cloth parsing relies on a pre-trained U^2-Net model. Download the weights
from [the official repository](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net/releases/download/v1.0/u2net.pth)
(about 176&nbsp;MB) and place the file at `~/.u2net/u2net.pth` or specify the
path when instantiating :class:`clothseg.ClothSegmenter`.

You can download the weights from the command line:

```bash
python clothseg.py --download-model
```

This will store the model in `~/.u2net/u2net.pth` by default.

## Registration

Users can register using one of several methods:

- **Email**: `POST /register/email` with `email` and `password` form fields.
- **Phone**: `POST /register/phone` with `phone` form field.
- **Google**: `POST /register/google` with an OAuth `token`.
- **Facebook**: `POST /register/facebook` with an OAuth `token`.

The application stores registration data solely in memory for
demonstration purposes. This data is neither secure nor persistent, so
it disappears when the server restarts and should not be used for any
real authentication needs.

## Running Tests

Execute the test suite using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```
